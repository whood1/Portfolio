I beleive the edits I want to make would be done through CSS, but the two go hand in hand and I’d rather just start with the foundations and learn HTML and CSS and get into good habits before I jump into the weeds more with Java and whatever else I want to get into.\nI’m rationalizing this by thinking of the value of having a professional website as a portfolio to show off my skills, and also to force myself in this self-study journey to take notes I can come back to.\nBasic HTML\rHTML is a tag-based language, it is built with elements. Elements have start and end tags, the end tag being identical except it starts with a forward slash. Elements can be within elements.\rSome tags like img or br are empty tags, there is only one (see below examples).\n\r!DOCTYPE\rStructure\rText \u0026amp; Images\rLists\rStyle\r\r!DOCTYPE\rThe top line of the html file has this code\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt;\r\rSignals that the file is written in HTML5 code.\rThe entire body of the html document is surround by the tag html.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; \r\rStructure\rThe actual page is split into the head, the meta data of the page, and the body, the actual body of the page.\rMetadata is information about the page that isnt displayed.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;html\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;head\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;\r\rText \u0026amp; Images\rWithin the header you can set the title, the text displayed on the browser tab.\rWithin the body, titles and subtitles can be made with h1 through h6, largest to smallest. Regular text can be written within paragraphs, p. A line break can be inserted anywhere with br. Images in the same folder as the html document can be inserted with img. A horizontal rule (horizontal line to speerate content) can be inserted with hr.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;html\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;head\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;title\u0026gt; Title \u0026lt;/title\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; Biggest Header\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;h6\u0026gt;Smallest Header\u0026lt;/6\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;p\u0026gt; Regular paragraph text\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;p\u0026gt; Broken \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Paragraph\u0026lt;/P\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;example.png\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;example alt text\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/html\rWithin the img tag, src signifies the image file name, alt represents the text that will show if for some reason the image cannot be displayed. Width and height set the width and height of the image.\nText within p tags cannot be formamted with spaces and line breaks without tags. Pre tags can be used to retain line breaks and extra spaces between words.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;html\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\rLine breaks\rand spaces maintained\r\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\rLine breaks and spaces NOT maintained\r\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;\r\rLists\rYou can make two types of simple lists, ordered and unordered.
