I can compare it to when I started working out and first noticed some more size/definition somehwere; I finally feel like I\u0026rsquo;m making progress and figuring things out, compartimentalizing and filing them away, gaining experience with the tools and systems used in industry, etc etc etc.\nBack to what this post is actually about.\nYesterday I started looking into what would be the best way to let people pay online from the website for tutoring instead of having to fuck around with paypal invoices or cash r anything like that thats just bound to stab my lazy ass in the back if I went with it. Started looking into other options, and went through a ton of them before finding things that would actually work. My current solution is to just let them pay and schedule time/date/location over email on an individual basis. If that gets out of hand I think I\u0026rsquo;ll have to migrate it to something that includes bookings, but I think that will be far enough in the future that waiting will be fine. I don\u0026rsquo;t anticipate enough volume for it to be an issue.\nTo the specifics, I ended up doing alot of research on different payment providers and eccomerce offerings. I ended up with Stripe; they seem like the most dedicated to technology and actually making things work properly and smoothly. I would have loved to use their builting Checkout thing but it wont work on a static Hugo website without jumping through hoops I dont want to deal with to setup some backend shit. I ended up sticking with stripe as the payment processor and link to my bank account, while using Snipcart on the front end for the actual shopping cart on the website.\nI think they also take some of my fucking money, but the customization and ease and scalability is probably worth it. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping that I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to intregare some kind of booking system with Snipcart itself, making make different products for each session and then only have 1 in stock per week? I\u0026rsquo;ll cross the bridge when it becomes an issue.\nBusiness Structure I also spent alot of time doing research as to how I should setup this business legally. The easiest and cheapest way seems to be just registering a DBA name with the town and hiring Lacey as a 1099 contractor and paying her hourly for whatever tutoring she does.\nIt may also be cool to try and get an LLC or something official sounding going that I can put on my resume and look ambitious, but I\u0026rsquo;ll save that for next summer (or I guess semester if things really take off? Not likely).\n","date":1558915200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558915200,"objectID":"8bbcc7b97da9581ce54ef670ee928915","permalink":"/post/setting-up-ecommerce/","publishdate":"2019-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/setting-up-ecommerce/","section":"post","summary":"Setting up E-Commerce After everything I learned yesterday trying to set this stuff up on ritutoring.com I really have been reinvorgorated to pursue what I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing.

Its simple and straightforward in the right kind of way; I can make something that looks nice and is function and serves an actual concrete purpose. Its starting with my feet on the ground while giving my some room to expand upwards. The name is still to be decided.\nPlanned Features Ideally I am making this app for myself; I want to be able to program and track workouts and weights, see progress over time and stats like that, be able to input notes about certain workouts. Maybe have a timer so a \u0026lsquo;workout\u0026rsquo; can be ran through and done with certain intervals. A long term calendar view, number of workouts until a cheat meal, etc.\nProgress So Far So far I have been reading through some \u0026lsquo;first java app\u0026rsquo; type tutorials. Understanding the file structure of apps in general, the terminology, the way things are structured nd put together, dealing with all the different android sizes and distributions and features (Not something I have considered up until now), and other things of that nature. My goal is to finish the tutorial I\u0026rsquo;ve been following and then just jump into making my app, just starting slow with the implementations, using git for version control, doing things right hopefully.

I\u0026rsquo;ve always used Windows as my main desktop, from XP to 10. A few years ago I installed Ubunut on my desktop to try and dual boot it, but lost interest. As I\u0026rsquo;m still thinking that I will pursue computer science, it would porbably be a good idea to get farmiliar with working in Linux sooner than later, so here I am :)\nResearch I set out to find some kind of balance between the regular GUI desktop enviornment I was farmiliar with, while also being able to learn some of the idiosyncracies of Linux (mainly just working in a CLI).\nThe first distro I installed was Fedora, but after trying to instlal a number of packages that would have been reuqired to run the software stack I use to run publish for this website, I switched to Mint. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s my fault and I just did not set something up properly, but I found Mint to be a much smoother ride while also teaching me more about what I\u0026rsquo;m doing than I felt I was learning in Fedora.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;ve Learned So Far First, I have to apologize to everyone who I made fun of for using Linux, now I see its utility as an ultra custominzable and minimal environemnt. Whenever I go back to using windows on my desktop it feels bloated in comparison to how spartan Mint is. Ive installed everyhing I need to publish this website, some of it from .deb simple installers and others through the command line, and pretty much have everything working now (even though I had to find some alternative programs to use i.e. GitKraken instead of Guthub Desktop and Remarkable instead of Caret or Typora for a markdown editor).\nGoing Forward I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to learn more about the nitty gritty and see the full potential of the operating system.\n","date":1558051200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558051200,"objectID":"72465ee338329f602396098cc18099bb","permalink":"/post/installing-linux-fedora-and-mint/","publishdate":"2019-05-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/installing-linux-fedora-and-mint/","section":"post","summary":"Installing Linux Mint \u0026amp; Fedora I have been hearing for years about the supposed benefits of working in a Linux operating system for programming and even as a regular computer user.

Elements have start and end tags, the end tag being identical except it starts with a forward slash. Elements can be within elements. Some tags like img or br are empty tags, there is only one (see below examples).\n !DOCTYPE Structure Text \u0026amp; Images Lists Style  !DOCTYPE The top line of the html file has this code\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt;  Signals that the file is written in HTML5 code. The entire body of the html document is surround by the tag html.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;   Structure The actual page is split into the head, the meta data of the page, and the body, the actual body of the page. Metadata is information about the page that isnt displayed.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;  Text \u0026amp; Images Within the header you can set the title, the text displayed on the browser tab. Within the body, titles and subtitles can be made with h1 through h6, largest to smallest. Regular text can be written within paragraphs, p. A line break can be inserted anywhere with br. Images in the same folder as the html document can be inserted with img. A horizontal rule (horizontal line to speerate content) can be inserted with hr.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt; Title \u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; Biggest Header\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt;Smallest Header\u0026lt;/6\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; Regular paragraph text\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; Broken \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Paragraph\u0026lt;/P\u0026gt; \u0026lt;hr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;example.png\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;example alt text\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html Within the img tag, src signifies the image file name, alt represents the text that will show if for some reason the image cannot be displayed. Width and height set the width and height of the image.\nText within p tags cannot be formamted with spaces and line breaks without tags.
