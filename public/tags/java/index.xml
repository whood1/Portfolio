      <description>After taking Gateway Computing: Java at Hopkins last semester, I have decided that making some kind of android app would probably be the best way to further my java knowledge and know-how, keep my coding skills sharp, and make something I can personally use and tht I can add to my resume as a project, and maybe even release.
The App I think fitness tracker/helper type app would be a good first option.</description>
