      <description>Setting up E-Commerce After everything I learned yesterday trying to set this stuff up on ritutoring.com I really have been reinvorgorated to pursue what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing. I can compare it to when I started working out and first noticed some more size/definition somehwere; I finally feel like I&amp;rsquo;m making progress and figuring things out, compartimentalizing and filing them away, gaining experience with the tools and systems used in industry, etc etc etc.</description>

      <description>Installing Linux Mint &amp;amp; Fedora I have been hearing for years about the supposed benefits of working in a Linux operating system for programming and even as a regular computer user. I&amp;rsquo;ve always used Windows as my main desktop, from XP to 10. A few years ago I installed Ubunut on my desktop to try and dual boot it, but lost interest. As I&amp;rsquo;m still thinking that I will pursue computer science, it would porbably be a good idea to get farmiliar with working in Linux sooner than later, so here I am :)</description>
