      <description>Setting up E-Commerce After everything I learned yesterday trying to set this stuff up on ritutoring.com I really have been reinvorgorated to pursue what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing. I can compare it to when I started working out and first noticed some more size/definition somehwere; I finally feel like I&amp;rsquo;m making progress and figuring things out, compartimentalizing and filing them away, gaining experience with the tools and systems used in industry, etc etc etc.</description>

      <description>After taking Gateway Computing: Java at Hopkins last semester, I have decided that making some kind of android app would probably be the best way to further my java knowledge and know-how, keep my coding skills sharp, and make something I can personally use and tht I can add to my resume as a project, and maybe even release.
The App I think fitness tracker/helper type app would be a good first option.</description>

      <description>Installing Linux Mint &amp;amp; Fedora I have been hearing for years about the supposed benefits of working in a Linux operating system for programming and even as a regular computer user. I&amp;rsquo;ve always used Windows as my main desktop, from XP to 10. A few years ago I installed Ubunut on my desktop to try and dual boot it, but lost interest. As I&amp;rsquo;m still thinking that I will pursue computer science, it would porbably be a good idea to get farmiliar with working in Linux sooner than later, so here I am :)</description>

      <description>I have created and setup a decent rough outline of my tutoring website (along with buying ritutoring.com and wlhood.com), but I want to edit the theme files to make it look better. I beleive the edits I want to make would be done through CSS, but the two go hand in hand and Iâ€™d rather just start with the foundations and learn HTML and CSS and get into good habits before I jump into the weeds more with Java and whatever else I want to get into.</description>

      <description>This simple personal website was made following this book: blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown
I am using it as a simple, easily managed portfolio and personal website, documenting personal projects and other content.
Technologies Used:  Markdown (Using Typora) R (Using R Studio) Github Netlify  All posts are written in Typora, my preferred Markdown editor. Markdown is a simple markup language, that I think makes exceptionally clean and modern websites.</description>
