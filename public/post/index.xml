      <description>Installing Linux Mint &amp;amp; Fedora I have been hearing for years about the supposed benefits of working in a Linux operating system for programming and even as a regular computer user. I&amp;rsquo;ve always used Windows as my main desktop, from XP to 10. A few years ago I installed Ubunut on my desktop to try and dual boot it, but lost interest. As I&amp;rsquo;m still thinking that I will pursue computer science, it would porbably be a good idea to get farmiliar with working in Linux sooner than later, so here I am :)</description>

      <description>I have created and setup a decent rough outline of my tutoring website (along with buying ritutoring.com and wlhood.com), but I want to edit the theme files to make it look better. I beleive the edits I want to make would be done through CSS, but the two go hand in hand and Iâ€™d rather just start with the foundations and learn HTML and CSS and get into good habits before I jump into the weeds more with Java and whatever else I want to get into.</description>

      <description>This simple personal website was made following this book: blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown
I am using it as a simple, easily managed portfolio and personal website, documenting personal projects and other content.
Technologies Used:  Markdown (Using Typora) R (Using R Studio) Github Netlify  All posts are written in Typora, my preferred Markdown editor. Markdown is a simple markup language, that I think makes exceptionally clean and modern websites.</description>
