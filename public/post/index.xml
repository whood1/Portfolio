      <description>This page is a continuation of the previous post about me learning HTML and CSS.
CSS Stands for Cascading Style Sheets, a way to define how HTML pages look. CSS can control how multiple pages look at once. Can be done inline, like with the previously mentioned style options.
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h1 style=&amp;quot;color:red&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Example Header &amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;Can also be done internally, within the style HTML tags within the head to set style for all the same elements in the HTML document.</description>

      <description>I have created and setup a decent rough outline of my tutoring website (along with buying ritutoring.com and wlhood.com), but I want to edit the theme files to make it look better. I beleive the edits I want to make would be done through CSS, but the two go hand in hand and I’d rather just start with the foundations and learn HTML and CSS and get into good habits before I jump into the weeds more with Java and whatever else I want to get into.</description>

      <description>This simple personal website was made following this book: blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown
I am using it as a simple, easily managed portfolio and personal website, documenting personal projects and other content.
Technologies Used:Markdown (Using Typora)R (Using R Studio)GithubNetlifyAll posts are written in Typora, my preferred Markdown editor. Markdown is a simple markup language, that I think makes exceptionally clean and modern websites.</description>
