### Installing Linux Mint & Fedora

I have been hearing for years about the supposed benefits of working in a Linux operating system for programming and even as a regular computer user. I've always used Windows as my main desktop, from XP to 10. A few years ago I installed Ubunut on my desktop to try and dual boot it, but lost interest. 
As I'm still thinking that I will pursue computer science, it would porbably be a good idea to get farmiliar with working in Linux sooner than later, so here I am :)


#### Research
I set out to find some kind of balance between the regular GUI desktop enviornment I was farmiliar with, while also being able to learn some of the idiosyncracies of Linux (mainly just working in a CLI).

The first distro I installed was Fedora, but after trying to instlal a number of packages that would have been reuqired to run the software stack I use to run publish for this website, I switched to Mint.
Maybe it's my fault and I just did not set something up properly, but I found Mint to be a much smoother ride while also teaching me more about what I'm doing than I felt I was learning in Fedora.

#### What I've Learned So Far
First, I have to apologize to everyone who I made fun of for using Linux, now I see its utility as an ultra custominzable and minimal environemnt. Whenever I go back to using windows on my desktop it feels bloated in comparison to how spartan Mint is.
Ive installed everyhing I need to publish this website, some of it from .deb simple installers and others through the command line, and pretty much have everything working now (even though I had to find some alternative programs to use i.e. GitKraken instead of Guthub Desktop and Remarkable instead of Caret or Typora for a markdown editor).

#### Going Forward
I can't wait to learn more about the nitty gritty and see the full potential of the operating system.
