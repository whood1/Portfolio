This page is a continuation of the previous post about me learning HTML and CSS.

CSS Stands for Cascading Style Sheets, a way to define how HTML pages look. CSS can control how multiple pages look at once. Can be done **inline**, like with the previously mentioned style options. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <body>
      <h1 style="color:red"> Example Header </h1>
   </body>
</html>
```
Can also be done **internally**, within the style HTML tags within the head to set style for all the same elements in the HTML document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <style>
         body {background-color: blue;}
         h1 {color: red;}
         p {color: yellow;}
      </style>
   </head>
</html>
```

Finally can be done externally with its own CSS file. This is linked to in the head section of a HTML document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
   </head>
</html>
```

CSS has many customizeable options like this, border, margin, padding, etc. Specific html elements can be given an id, image you wanted to have every paragraph but one red, and the last one blue.  You can set an internal paragraph style and give the different paragraph a specific id that will only set the color for that one element.
This same idea is applicable through the class attribute, instead of one specific id to one specific element, classes of elements with the same styling can be created

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <style>
        p {color: red;}
        #pBlue {color: blue:}
        p.exampleClass {color: yellow;}

      </style>
   </head>

   <body>
      <p>Red</p>
      <p>Red</p>
      <p>Red</p>
      <p id="pBlue"> Blue <p>
      <p class="exampleClass"> Example </p>
      <p class="exampleClass"> Same styling, same class </p>
   </body>

</html>
```

We have already talked about links, but they can also be customized by css, changing appearanece and functionality of links. Images are commonly made into links.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <body>
      <a href="https://Google.com">
         <img src="example.png" alt="Example Image" widith="400" height="200">
      </a>
   </body>
</html>
```
