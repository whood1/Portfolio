<h1>Creating This Website</h1>
<p>This simple personal website was made following this book: <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown</a></p>
<p>I am using it as a simple, easily managed portfolio and personal website, documenting personal projects and other content.</p>
<div id="technologies-used" class="section level3">
<h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Markdown (Using Typora)</li>
<li>R (Using R Studio)</li>
<li>Github</li>
<li>Netlify</li>
</ul>
<p>All posts are written in Typora, my preferred Markdown editor. Markdown is a simple markup language, that I think makes exceptionally clean and modern websites.</p>
<p>The website is generated using blogdown and hugo, as described in the mentioned book. The theme is <a href="https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic">Academic</a>, which again I think is lightweight and stylish.</p>
<p>As the website is edited or new posts created, the files are updated in a Github repository that is then linked to Netlify and automatically updated.</p>
<p>As of writing this, my next aim is to further customize and optimize the site for my purposes, and to purchase and setup a domain name, along with launching a similar website for my planned tutoring business.</p>
