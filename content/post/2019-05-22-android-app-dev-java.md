After taking Gateway Computing: Java at Hopkins last semester, I have decided that making some kind of android app would probably be the best way to further my java knowledge and know-how, keep my coding skills sharp, and make something I can personally use and tht I can add to my resume as a project, and maybe even release.

### The App
I think fitness tracker/helper type app would be a good first option. Its simple and straightforward in the right kind of way; I can make something that looks nice and is function and serves an actual concrete purpose. Its starting with my feet on the ground while giving my some room to expand upwards.
The name is still to be decided.

##### Planned Features
Ideally I am making this app for myself; I want to be able to program and track workouts and weights, see progress over time and stats like that, be able to input notes about certain workouts.
Maybe have a timer so a 'workout' can be ran through and done with certain intervals. A long term calendar view, number of workouts until a cheat meal, etc. 

### Progress So Far
So far I have been reading through some 'first java app' type tutorials. Understanding the file structure of apps in general, the terminology, the way things are structured nd put together, dealing with all the different android sizes and distributions and features (Not something I have considered up until now), and other things of that nature.
My goal is to finish the tutorial I've been following and then just jump into making my app, just starting slow with the implementations, using git for version control, doing things right hopefully. Cheers.
